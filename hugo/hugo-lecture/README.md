# Hugo-Lecture

## Overview

This project defines a selection of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
[archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/),
[layouts](https://gohugo.io/templates/),
[partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/) and
[shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)
for creating and publishing teaching materials on
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

This repo is intended to be included in the target project as a
[Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
to partially overwrite the main theme, i.e. [Hugo Relearn Theme](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn).

_Note_: This is a merge of the
[Hugo-Lecture-Archetypes](https://github.com/cagix/Hugo-Lecture-Archetypes)
and [Hugo-Lecture-Layouts](https://github.com/cagix/Hugo-Lecture-Layouts)
repositories, which won't receive any further maintenance now.
