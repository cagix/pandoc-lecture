\clearpage
\myQuestion[5]{Long questions}

* You can combine the mentioned environments. 

* In case, a question needs to start on a new page, add a `\clearpage` 
  before the `\myQuestion` command.
  
* If you want a page break after the question, end the question with
  `\clearpage`.


\Fortsetzung
\clearpage


* If the question is really long, you can indicate this using the `\Fortsetzung`
  LaTeX macro. This prints the string "Fortsetzung" at the bottom of the page
  to indicate the continuation of the question on the next page to the students.
  
  Note, currently this is not equivalent to a `\clearpage`, i.e. you need to
  use an explicit `\clearpage`.
