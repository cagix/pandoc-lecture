# Long questions {punkte=5}

*   You can combine the mentioned environments.

*   In case a question needs to start on a new page, use a level 1 header
    (otherwise start a question with a level 2 header).

*   If you want a page break *after* the question, end the question with
    `\clearpage`.


\Fortsetzung
\clearpage


*   If the question is really long, you can indicate this using the `\Fortsetzung`
    LaTeX macro. This prints the string "Fortsetzung" at the bottom of the page
    to indicate the continuation of the question on the next page to the students.

    Note, currently this is not equivalent to a `\clearpage`, i.e. you need to
    use an explicit `\clearpage`.
